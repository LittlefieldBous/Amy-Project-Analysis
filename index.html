    <h2>Site Intent</h2>
   </header>
   
    <h3>Client Goals</h3> 
   
   <div class="wrap">
   
   <p><strong>Main Objective:</strong> The client's main objective is to improve upon the existing Vista Print 
   website in order to increase clientele.</p> 
   
   <p>The current site is a very simple website hosted by Vista Print and at this time serves as a way for internet users to 
   contact and locate the salon in Elk Rapids, Michigan. In order to find the Beehive salon on the Web, a potential customer would probably 
   type in the keywords, "Elk Rapids, MI" and the word "hair," or some combination thereof. The current site only helps to list the 
   business similar to what the Yellow Pages used to accomplish prior to the World Wide Web.</p>
   
   <p><strong>In order to increase the salon's clientele, the client would like the site to help 
   accomplish the following goals:</strong></p>
   
   <div>
    <ul>
     <li>To make a responsive website, so that her business is more visible/accessible not just on a computer screen but for the mobile phone users.</li>
     <li>To entice the new customer to choose her salon over her competitors. The owner wishes not only to continue to grow the local clientele but also draw in the numerous people that visit this 
    tourist lake town throughout the year</li>
     <li>The client would like her site to be aesthetically pleasing and 
     set a tone. Adjectives that conjure up the desired tone include: serene, rejuvenating, relaxing, pampered, hip and friendly.</li>
     <li>The site is user friendly and easy to navigate</li>
     <li>To allow the user to easily locate and contact the salon for an appointment</li>
     <li>For users to learn about the services offered at Beehive Salon</li>
     <li> To use the site as a means of communicating with clientele as well as new customers when offering discounts or specials.</li>
     <li>to increase traffic to the salon's Facebook page. The owner hopes to use this as a means to 
     foster clientele/business relationships that will increase earnings and grow/maintain her business in the local economy.</li> 
     <li>To convey that the business is eco-friendly and uses natural products.</li>
     <li> For the clientele to identify that the Beehive Salon offers Aveda products. A trusted company for natural hair products.</li>
    </ul>
   </div>

   <h3>User Goals</h3>
   </header>
   
   <p>The user goals (whether a local or a tourist) includes:</p>
   
   <div>
   <ul>
   		<li> To be able to contact and locate salon services in the area online. (for hair-cuts,manicures etc.)</li>
        <li> To locate the salon.</li>
   		<li> To be able to compare prices, find out about any discounts or specials the salon has to offer.</li> 
  		<li> To find out the salon's hours and availability for booking an appointment. Some users would also prefer to book an appointment online.</li> 
        <li> The user or target audience also looks for stylists with expertise.</li>
        <li> A salon that presents a serene and relaxing atmosphere.</li>
        <li> A salon that conveys the message that they will leave the experience looking better and feeling rejuvenated.</li>  
        <li> Some users also indicate that natural products and a business that communicates an eco-friendly feel will win over a salon 
        that doesn't offer natural hair products.</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Analysis was determined from the Client Survey collected on 10/03/13. Client plans to collect more data 
    during the summer months when more tourists arrive.</p>

    <h3>Demographics</h3> 

    <p><strong>The following salons all share the same demographics as the Beehive Salon. 
    These demographics are as follows:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Approximately 70% women 20% children and 10% men. Their clients typically consist of females. However they do provide hair-cuts to children and men.</li> 
    <li>Location: Village by Lake Michigan. Customers consist of Northern Michigan locals, tourists. Many tourists have cottages or are boaters/yacht owners typically from Chicago and the suburbs of Detroit.</li>
    <li>Household income:  30K - 500K+ a year. This can range from lower middle class to the extremely wealthy, especially during the summertime.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Note:</strong>The drawback is that the local economy can be a somewhat seasonal with summer being the biggest draw for tourism.
    Although there are many ski-resorts, wineries, breweries and fall color tours that do 
    bring a certain amount of tourists during the off-months, in the winter months (after the holidays) it helps to run specials.</p>
